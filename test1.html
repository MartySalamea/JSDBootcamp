        <h1>Poorman Get Rich</h1>
        <p>Many people believe that the rich only become rich at the expense of others. This world view is also called zero-sum thinking because its adherents regard economic life as a zero-sum game, just like tennis, where one player has to lose for the other to win. In his poem “Alfabet,” the German poet Bertolt Brecht formulated this zero-sum mindset as follows:

“Said the poor man with a twitch:

Were I not poor, you wouldn’t be rich.”
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Freedom from financial worry</ls>
            <li>its more fun</ls>

It is one way to measure my success
To contribute to the national and world economy through my enterprise. George S. Clason wrote, “Our prosperity as a nation depends upon the personal financial prosperity of each of us as individuals.”*
It is more fun</li>
